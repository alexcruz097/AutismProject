                    million people are diagnosed with autism, according to statistics from Autism Speaks Organization.
                    It is extremely alarming, in that 1 out of 54 children are diagnosed with the autism in America
                    alone.

                    views and stance on the subject, and how Autism has been presented or branded in the past. The jig
                    saw puzzle was adopted in 1963 in the United Kingdom as a symbol to create Awareness for Autism, and
                    was later taken up by Autism Speaks in America.Today, it has become a common them running through
                    most of the recognizable symbols for the CAUSE. The need for the awareness of the autism which in
                    our view is a"pandemic" and cannnot be overemphasized, since it touches and impacts people ALL
                    acccross the globe.Families affected by a diagnosis of autism scramble to find answers and
                    information, and are forced to sift through myths and tons of information to find the needed
                    answers. Although Autism is not a "death sentence".

                <p>
                    Autism is something people are born with. No one has a clear indication or answers to what causes
                    it. It probably have something to do with a child's genes and and other contributing factor surrounding how the brain is developed.
                    <br>

                    A Doctor examines a child during checkup and when there is suspicion that a child is not reaching some developmental milestones, a team of 
                    experts then determine if a child has autism or not. For example 
                1.If a child is not as engaged a should be at a certain stage, or deficiency in 
                  socio-emotinal reciprocracy, reduced interest, emotions, failure to initiate or respond to social interactions.
                   <br>

                 2.Deficient in building relationships, understanding and maintaining and difficulties in the ability to shift or adjust  behaivior to suit 
                   different social contexts, to difficulty in making friends, sharing in imaginative play, to complete absence of interest in peers.
                   
                   <br>
                3.Total lack of facial expressions, in non verbal communication, abnormalities in eye contact, or difficient in the understanding and the use 
                     of gestures.
